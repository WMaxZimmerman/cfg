# cfg
My config files for CSGO

For easy setup I suggest that you navigat to your cfg path
(c:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/userdata/<userId>/730/local)
Delete the entire cfg folder and then clone this repository here.
This will create a new cfg folder that contains everything from
this repository and will set you up to be able to pull without issue.



If for some reason your scripts aren't coming through you can try to add:

+exec autoexec

to the launch options for CSGO.
